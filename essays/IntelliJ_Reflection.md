Coding Standards with IntelliJ

Over the course of the past four weeks, JSFiddle and IntelliJ have been used to learn Javascript, as well as how to implement the Underscore library. While JSFiddle was a very primitive type of development environment, it was also very simple. Not many configurations were required by the user, and adding external items (i.e. Underscore library) was very simple. On the other hand, IntelliJ is the polar opposite of JSFiddle. IntelliJ is an application downloaded to the userâ€™s machine, and there is a plethora of options and configurations that can be applied. 

While the IntelliJ was a useful desktop application, the vast amount of ways in which one could configure the settings was overwhelming. There were various options, such as uploading a file to implement coding standards, which was used during the experience with IntelliJ. The file would give instructions to IntelliJ on how the code should be formatted within a file. For example, no extra blank lines between a curly brace and a new line of code, spaces between certain items, and so forth. I felt that having this feature was a bit cumbersome, but somewhat useful when it came to eliminating unnecessary items in code, such as extra blank lines. 

The biggest adjustments that had to be made with IntelliJ was the configuration of a new project and adding all the files and their paths. With JSFiddle, adding an external library, such as a database, was as easy as just inputting a link into the external resources area. IntelliJ, on the other hand, required the Underscore library be added via an extra HTML file containing the URL link within the same folder as the working JavaScript file. This was a bit inconvenient, though not difficult. 

Also, mixed with the GitHub Desktop application, determining the right path was slightly confusing as well, especially when it came to paths for files. For example, during the in-class Workout Of the Day, IntelliJ had automatically stored my files in the GitHub Desktop application instead of my github folder on my desktop, this contributed to my DNF result as I could not locate my files and push them to Git in a timely matter. Oddly, during the practice WODs, I did not have this issue. During the practice WODs, my finish time primarily landed within the Sd time range at just under 25 minutes. 

Overall, the experience with using IntelliJ was useful, though it felt a bit rushed. However, continuous use of IntelliJ will give more time to adjust to the vast amount of options and different way of configuring projects.

The Benefits and Applications of Software Engineering

   Within the Computer Science field, software engineering is crucial to have an understanding of. Though not all of those in the field are software engineers, but other fields, such as cryptography, have a strong relation to software engineering. Personally, I have a deep interest in Cyber Security. From this class, I hope to apply the experiences and skills gained to my field of interest.
   
   The ICS program at UH Manoa already integrates several classes that focus on programming. From this course, I hope to gain an understanding of the methodology of software engineering, not just another programming language. By understanding the methodology, such as best practices, how to perform under certain circumstances, I hope to be able to apply this to cyber security, and vice versa. For example, be able to give constructive feedback on a penetration testing project. Also, to implement security practices from the early steps of a project, in contrast to the popular "security as an afterthought" software development process.
    
   So far, this course has also emphasized the importance of being having a professional persona. Prior to this course, I have a good understanding of how to go through interviews, write a resume, and so forth. However, I hope to gain an understanding of how to apply my existing knowledge, and gain an understanding of how to develop a professional persona for the Computer Science field. For example, how to incorporate my past projects into my portfolio, what tools to use for networking with others in the field, etc.
    
   Lastly, I hope to expand my knowledge of various programming tools. After reviewing the schedule for this semester, I saw that MongoDB is something covered. MongoDB is a tool I have heard about and seen, but never got hands on experience with. I hope to expand my knowledge on it, along with other tools and languages that will be covered in this course.

Overview

Similar to the Study Buddy project, an application can be designed to allow students to form groups to converse in a second language. The goal is to help students improve or maintain speaking skills for another language. This is particularly useful due to the second language requirement, and the diverse population at UH Manoa.

Mockup Page Ideas

Main page will have to links to pages specific to each language. Additionally, a link to a form to request a group for a language not listed. All requests will be listed, such that if a page hasn't been created for a specific language, students can still see if there is interest in a new language group. There can also be a discussion forum for students to discuss topics such as a new language group, external club meetings and events, etc.

Use Case Ideas

For example, the main page may start out with pages for Japanese, Chinese, and Korean. The discussion forum may be used by international students to suggest a Spanish page. Also, the forum can be used to announce the need for English tutors for Japanese exchange students.

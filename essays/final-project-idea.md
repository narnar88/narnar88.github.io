Overview

Similar to the Study Buddy project idea covered in class, an application can be designed to allow students to connect with other students looking to converse in another language. The goal is to help students improve or maintain speaking skills for a given language. This is particularly useful due to the second language requirement, and the diverse population at UH Manoa. Some students may want more practice with another language outside of the classroom, also some foreign or exchange students may want to enhnace their English skills.

Mockup Page Ideas

Main page will have to links to pages specific to each language. Additionally, there will be a link to a form to request a group for a language not listed. All requests will be listed for Admin users to see, and eventually implement, such that if a page hasn't been created for a specific language, Admin users can see if there is interest in a new language group. There will be a home page that can also serve as a discussion forum for students to discuss topics such as a new language group, external club meetings and events, etc., that do not pertain to just one forum, or relates to a topic for which there is no existing forum.

Use Case Ideas

For example, the main page may start out with pages for Japanese, Chinese, and Korean. The discussion forum may be used by international students to suggest a Spanish page. Also, the forum can be used to announce the need for English tutors for Japanese exchange students.
